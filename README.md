# Z language 
An easy, simple, yet universal coding language to be used for markup, styling, and programming. The purpose of introducing Z was 2 reasons: 
1. To make blogging easier (thus the introduction of colours), and
2. To make web development easier (thus the introduction of code blocks)

See the wiki for how the language works for pull requests.

Note: **All** markdown should be readable in Z. Z is simply a superset of markdown: it offers features not in markdown to make up for other aspects of web development. 

Markdown is already simple. I simply wish to generalize the simplicity of markdown.
